############################## TASK BREAKDOWN #########################################
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
construct two Web pages using the HTML we covered in
WDUX01. (done) 
One should contain some information about who you are (and what
organisation you work for, if that's relevant) 
and why you're doing this course. (done)

The other page should contain links to five Web sites that you consider "good". (done)

This can be in terms of their design or their functionality or for some other reason. (done)

I'd like you to put these two pages in *separate* directories on your
Web site. (done)

Both pages should contain a link to the other page. (done)

So page one will contain a link to page two and page two will contain a link to
page one. (done)

Additionally, I'd like you to make one of the links an
absolute link (i.e. starting with a /) and the other a relative link. (done)

(Make sure that you read the above instructions carefully. I guarantee
that one of you will include two absolute links or two relative links or
will include links that start with a http://!)

Once you've created these pages then I'd like you to upload them to your
Web space using an FTP program and then send the URL of one of the pages
to me. (done)

    My original attempt at site navigation is below. I then altered this after doing some research around divs, sections and this eventually led me onto HTML5 nav tags. 
            
        <div id="site_navigation">
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
                    <li><a href="favouritesites.html">My Favourite Sites</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="page_navigation">
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#who">Who Am I</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#reasons">Reasons</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#experience">Experience of</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#aware">Aware of</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#want">Where else do I want to take this in the future?</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

    The <section> tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.
    https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_section.asp

    Q - With regard to sections I am not sure if I have used these correctly? Should the H1 tags be held within <header> tags within each section? It got a bit confusing when reading. 

    Q - Is there a big impact on using HTML5 tags, i.e. are there many browsers out there that wouldn't be able to use them any more?
    
    I found the following while trying to answer this:
        In addition, you can "teach" older browsers how to handle "unknown elements".
        https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

    Q - I assume this means we should all be developing in HTML5 and where our audience might be using older browsers we would code to handle the unknown elements?

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        
        <p>I have taught the basics of HTML for a number of years in school but never had the time, more importantly the structure of learning, to build a website in full from scratch.</p>
        
        <p>The structure of this course along with the extrinsic motivation of both deadlines and peers should give me a chance to develop my knowledge further and in a practical setting.</p>
        
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>I have experience of using the following CSS on basic sites:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Formatting style with CSS
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hovers</li>
                            <li>Backgrounds</li>
                            <li>Borders</li>
                            <li>Fonts</li>
                            <li>Rounded Corners</li>
                            <li>Gradients</li>
                            <li>Shadows</li>
                            <li>Colours</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        <p>Some awareness and basic attempts at:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Formatting layout with CSS
                        <ul>
                            <li>Box Model</li>
                            <li>Padding</li>
                            <li>Margins</li>
                            <li>Media Queries</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        
        <p>I would like to get a much stronger understanding of HTML and CSS. In particular I want to really develop an understanding of building high quality responsive websites.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h1 id="future">Where else do I want to take this in the future?</h1>

        <p>I have had an interest in design for a while. I therefore wish to get a good knowledege of design techniques. I want to use this course as a platform to further my learning longer term to eventually develop fully dynamic websites</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the future:
                <ul>
                    <li>setup my own Web Apps based around edutech
                        <ul>
                            <li>learn JavaScript</li>
