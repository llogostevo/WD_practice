        <h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>
        
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        
        <p>I have taught the basics of HTML for a number of years in school but never had the time, more importantly the structure of learning, to build a website in full from scratch.</p>
        
        <p>The structure of this course along with the extrinsic motivation of both deadlines and peers should give me a chance to develop my knowledge further and in a practical setting.</p>
        
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>I have experience of using the following CSS on basic sites:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Formatting style with CSS
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hovers</li>
                            <li>Backgrounds</li>
                            <li>Borders</li>
                            <li>Fonts</li>
                            <li>Rounded Corners</li>
                            <li>Gradients</li>
                            <li>Shadows</li>
                            <li>Colours</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        <p>Some awareness and basic attempts at:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Formatting layout with CSS
                        <ul>
                            <li>Box Model</li>
                            <li>Padding</li>
                            <li>Margins</li>
                            <li>Media Queries</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        
        <p>I would like to get a much stronger understanding of HTML and CSS. In particular I want to really develop an understanding of building high quality responsive websites.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h1 id="future">Where else do I want to take this in the future?</h1>

        <p>I have had an interest in design for a while. I therefore wish to get a good knowledege of design techniques. I want to use this course as a platform to further my learning longer term to eventually develop fully dynamic websites</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the future:
                <ul>
                    <li>setup my own Web Apps based around edutech
                        <ul>
