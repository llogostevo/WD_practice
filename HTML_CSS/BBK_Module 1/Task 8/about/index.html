<!--
construct two Web pages using the HTML we covered in
WDUX01.
One should contain some information about who you are (and what
organisation you work for, if that's relevant)
and why you're doing this course.

The other page should contain links to five Web sites that you consider "good".

This can be in terms of their design or their functionality or for some other reason.

I'd like you to put these two pages in *separate* directories on your
Web site.

Both pages should contain a link to the other page.

So page one will contain a link to page two and page two will contain a link to
page one.

Additionally, I'd like you to make one of the links an
absolute link (i.e. starting with a /) and the other a relative link.

(Make sure that you read the above instructions carefully. I guarantee
that one of you will include two absolute links or two relative links or
will include links that start with a http://!)

Once you've created these pages then I'd like you to upload them to your
Web space using an FTP program and then send the URL of one of the pages
to me.

	<h2 id="who">Who Am I</h2>

	<p>I am an assistant head teacher at <a href="http://www.centralfoundationboys.co.uk">Central Foundation Boys School</a></p>

	<img src="http://www.centralfoundationboys.co.uk/wp-content/gallery/code/website-header.png" alt="Central Foundation Boys School Website Header" width="100%" style="max-width:600px">

	<h2 id="reasons">Reasons for taking the course</h2>
	<p>As part of my Vocational role I am aiming to make students employable in front end web development through a project based approach. As such I need to upskill to get myself to a proficient standard in Web Development. I have taught computer science for the last 10 years and have some knowledge of web design previously.

I am able to use basic CSS on web pages to change appearance but need time to learn how to manipulate layout.</p>

<p>I have basic experience of the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li id="experience">Experience of:
			<ul>
				<li>Formatting style with CSS
					<ul>
						<li>Hovers</li>
						<li>Backgrounds</li>
						<li>Borders</li>
						<li>Fonts</li>
						<li>Rounded Corners</li>
						<li>Gradients</li>
						<li>Shadows</li>
						<li>Colours</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li id="aware">Aware of / Tried:
			<ul>
				<li>Formatting layout with CSS
					<ul>
						<li>Box Model</li>
						<li>Padding</li>
						<li>Margins</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>


<h3 id="want">What do I want from the course?</h3>

<p>I would like to get a strong understanding of CSS and formatting layout. In the future I want to potentially setup my own Web Apps based around edu tech and would like to start off with HTML / CSS to get a good understanding. Later I want to get learn JavaScript and so might take one a shortcourses in JavaScript.</p>

<p>I have considered whether I should then perhaps look into a framework such as Node.js. I have some experience of PHP from University, although this is 15 years ago now.</p>

<p>I have experience of procedural programming in Python, I have attempted to learn Django before but failed miserably. I then learnt the basics of ruby and attempted to learn rails, again I failed miserably.</p>

<p>Eventually I would like to get to a stage where I can develop to web apps using a suitable language to interogate a database. I have fairly good knowledge of DB design. The big failing I have had whenever I try to get into this is my lack of time, priorities of the day to day job cause issues for me in the long run. I also found that I would get frustrated and try and run before I could walk. </p>

<p>So for this reason I decided to take a step back and begin by getting a detailed understanding of HTML and CSS as starting point</p>

<p>The structure of a course with clear deadline is key to giving me a focus to learn.</p>
