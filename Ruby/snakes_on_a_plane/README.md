# snakes_on_a_plane

There are two gangs of rival snakes, each with three members, in the aisle of a plane and they need to go past each other. Unfortunately, both groups of snakes were busy frightening the passengers and didn't notice the other group until there was only a one snake-sized gap in between them. The snakes cannot occupy the same space as each other (they will fight!), but they can hop over one snake as long as there is a gap on the other side. They prefer moving to an empty space to hopping. How can they all get past safely? The task is to solve this problem using an array.

The diagram below illustrates the problem.
