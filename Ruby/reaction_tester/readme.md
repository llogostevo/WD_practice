Problem
A reaction tester is a simple program that times how long it takes for the user to see a message and react to it by pressing a button. 

The reaction tester can be completed without using a loop at all. 
However, in a later lesson, 
the students will encounter some requirements from a client which they will need to 
analyse to decide how they will use loops to implement the solution.

In most languages you usually need to use library functions to generate random numbers and act as a timer. 
These vary according to the language. 
Some languages are not suitable for this task, for example, PHP is processed on the server side and would not work.

When you make a program it is usually for a client and not yourself. 
You to collect information from the client, analyse that information and then produce a solution. 
It is important that your solution matches the clients need otherwise the system will fail.
