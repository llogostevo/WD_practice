Problem
'What am I?' is a simple classification game. The user must think of a type of pet and the computer will then ask a series of yes-or-no questions before it attempts to guess what the pet is.

For example, the computer might ask ‘Does the pet have legs?’. The response to the question causes the program to branch and ask further questions depending on whether the answer was ‘yes’ or ‘no’. For example, if the answer to ‘Does the pet have legs?’ is no, it makes no sense to ask ‘Does the pet have eight legs?’. The task is to write a program that can use the answer to a question to make a decision about what to do next.

Don't get caught up with all the questions, make 6 questions that can branch either way to then give a result. 


Animal Suggestions: Monkey, Dog, Rabbit, Cat, Cow, Lion

Question Suggestions: Are you a pet? Do you have 4 legs? Are you a Cat? Do you roar? 

Examples of reporting
Design
You could ask students to think more carefully about designing the program before they write it. What animals are included in the classification? How could they ask the minimum number of questions to get to a sensible result? What will the interface look like? What will the example user input look like?
